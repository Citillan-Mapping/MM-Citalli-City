**A map I made for the hit indie game Mini Metro**

Travel bound the snow and ice and take charge of the vast and enormous metro system of this futuristic technocratic metropolis. Can you unify the far ends of this bustling and lively polar capital of 55 million?

Take a trip all around Citalli City, Mini Metro's first map set in an alternative future, where Citalli, a massive Technocratic, polar empire, rises onto the global stage. enjoy the tour of this arctic capital with it's many modernist, minimalist, and sleek looking skyscrapers dominating the icy skyline while listening to the sound the many languages spoken by the diverse population that make up this massive city.

this is the first of the Citillan Alternative Future series of maps to come to Mini Metro. more are to come soon.
